//?     [Problem Definition]
//*     The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:
//*       Weight of Package (in Kilograms)              Rate per 500 Miles Shipped
//*        2 kg or less                                            $1.10
//*        Over 2 kg but not more than 6 kg                        $2.20
//*        Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg                        $3.70
//*        Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg                      $4.80
//*     Example
//*        Package weight = 15 kg, Distance = 650 miles
//*             Shipping Price = (distance / 500.0) * rate;
//*                                = 650 / 500.0 * 4.80 

//*     Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and 
//*     the distance it is to beshipped, and then displays the charges.
//** Input Validation : 
//* Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight of the package. 
//* Do not accept weights of more than 20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship). 
//* Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles. 
//*     These are the companyâ€™s minimum and maximum shipping distances.
